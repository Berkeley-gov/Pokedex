# Pokedex

Project URL: https://berkeley-gov.github.io/Pokedex/

## Introduction
This project is based on one of my favorite childhood animated show, Pokémon. It is part of my software engineering portfolio and it demonstrates my ability to use multiple front-end technologies to build a simple one-page web application. 

### Summary
The Pokedex application uses the Poke API, a modern RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.
The API allows for HTTP GET requests only so users are only allowed to retrieve data and not manipulate. This will allow a client to only fetch data regarding a Pokémon the user inquired for.
For more information regarding the Poke API, please visit this link: _https://pokeapi.co/about_

### Project Aim
The goal of this project was to provide a user interface that allows Pokémon enthusiast to search for a Pokémon either by name, or their index to obtain data regarding the Pokémon's attack, defense, type, weight, etc. In other words, the aim was to mimic the user interface and functionality based on the Pokedex from the animated show.

### Technologies
The following technologies were used to build this project:
* Bootstrap: v4.4.1
* HTML5
* JavaScript: ES6 (Fetch API)
* Postman (API testing)
* DBeaver
